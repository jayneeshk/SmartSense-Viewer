# Face detecting video player
This application is designed with a singular purpose: to initiate video playback upon detecting an individual in the camera's proximity, and subsequently pause playback in the absence of any individual. Remarkably, the application incorporates an intelligent feature wherein the audio volume of the video dynamically adjusts based on the person's distance from the camera. As the individual approaches the camera, the audio gradually decreases to maintain a considerate environment. Conversely, when the person moves away, the application intelligently increases the video's audio volume. This nuanced interplay between video initiation, pause, and adaptive audio modulation exemplifies the application's commitment to a sophisticated and user-centric multimedia experience.
